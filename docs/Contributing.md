# Ways to contribute

- Found a **bug** or have an idea for a **new feature**? [Join the chat](https://s.jrpie.de/launcher-chat) or open an [issue](https://github.com/jrpie/Launcher/issues/).
    > Please note that I work on this project in my free time. Thus I might not respond immediately and not all ideas will be implemented.
- Implement a new feature yourself:
    1. [Fork](https://github.com/jrpie/launcher/fork) this repository.
    2. Create a **new branch** named *feature/\<your feature\>* or *fix/\<your fix\>* and commit your changes.
    3. Open a new pull request.
- Add or improve [translations](https://toolate.othing.xyz/projects/jrpie-launcher/).
