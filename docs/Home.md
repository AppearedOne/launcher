# Welcome to the μLauncher wiki

We're thrilled you're here and confident you'll love your new Android launcher! Check out this wiki to get familiar with your new app.

## What is μLauncher

µLauncher is an *minimal* and *distraction-free* Android home screen that lets you launch apps using *efficient* swipe gestures and button presses. This project is a fork of [finnmglas's app Launcher](https://github.com/finnmglas/Launcher). An incomplete list of changes can be found [here](https://github.com/wassupluke/Launcher/blob/master/docs/launcher.md).
