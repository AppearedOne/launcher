Tweaks and customizations can be made from within the Launcher Settings page.

These settings let you change wallpapers, change colors and fonts, enable monochrome app icons, change the app drawer layout, and much more.

In the following documentation, 'app drawer' will be used to refer to the 'All Apps' and 'Favorite Apps' views.

# Functionality

> ### Launch search results

Launches any app that matches user keyboard input when no other apps match.

As you type inside the app drawer, the app narrows down the list of apps shown based on the app title matching your text input. For example, if you type, `a`, the app list narrows to any apps with a title containing the letter `a`. Continuing the example, if you then follow your `a` with the letter `m`, the list now shows only apps containing the letter combination `am` in that order. If the only app matching this combination was, for example, `Amazon`, simply typing `am` in the app drawer would immediately launch the `Amazon` app for you.

This feature becomes more powerful when combined with [renaming](https://github.com/wassupluke/Launcher/wiki/Launcher-Settings/_edit#additional-settings) apps, effectively letting you define custom app names that could be considered 'aliases' or shortcuts. For instance, if you wanted to "bind" the keyboard input `gh` to open your `GitHub` app, you could rename `GitHub` to `GitHub gh`, `gh GitHub`, or simply `gh`. Assuming no other installed apps have the `gh` combination of letters in them, opening the app drawer and typing `gh` would immediately launch your `GitHub` app.

Press space to temporarily disable this feature and allow text entry without prematurely launching an app. Useful when combined with the [Search the web](https://github.com/wassupluke/Launcher/wiki/Launcher-Settings/_edit#search-the-web) feature.

**type:**&nbsp;`toggle`

> ### Search the web

Press return/enter while searching the app list to launch a web search.

**type:**&nbsp;`toggle`

> ### Start keyboard for search

Automatically open the keyboard when the app drawer is opened.

**type:**&nbsp;`toggle`

> ### Double swipe actions

Enable double swipe (two finger) actions as bindable gestures in launcher settings. Does not erase gesture bindings if accidentally turned off.

**type:**&nbsp;`toggle`

> ### Edge swipe actions

Enable edge swipe (near edges of screen) actions as bindable gestures in launcher settings. Does not erase gesture bindings if accidentally turned off.

**type:**&nbsp;`toggle`

> ### Edge width

Change how large a margin is used for detecting edge gestures. Shows the edge margin preview when using the slider.

**type:**&nbsp;`slider`

> ### Choose method for locking the screen

There are two methods to lock the screen and unfortunately both have downsides.
1. **`Device Admin`**
  - Doesn't work with unlocking by fingerprint or face recognition.
2. **`Accessibility Service`**
  - Requires excessive privileges.
  - Î¼Launcher will use those privileges *only* for locking the screen.
  - As a rule of thumb, it is [not recommended](https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/248171/is-it-safe-to-give-accessibility-permission-to-an-app) to grant access to accessibility services on a random app. Always review the [source code](https://github.com/jrpie/Launcher) before granting accessibility permissions so you familiarize yourself with what the code might do.
  - On some devices, the start-up PIN will no longer be used for encrypting data after activating an accessibility service.
    - This can be [reactivated](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37010136#comment36) afterwards.
